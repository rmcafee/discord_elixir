# Discord Ex - Discord Elixir Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rmcafee/discord_ex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rmcafee/discord_ex) [![Hex pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/discord_ex.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/discord_ex)

### Due to time constraints and Discord changes this project has become stale. A new co-maintainer is in the works to help work on a major update that should make the library easier to use and resolve some issues.

Discord library for Elixir. I needed it and figured I'd share.

This library is useful for making calls and implementing a bot as well.

Please always use [Discord Developer Docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs) as a reference.

## Installation

1. Add discord_ex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
# From Hex
def deps do
    [{:discord_ex, "~> 1.1.18"}]
end
```

```elixir
# From Github
def deps do
  [{:discord_ex, git: "https://github.com/rmcafee/discord_ex.git", tag: "1.1.18"}]
end
```

2. Ensure discord_ex is started before your application:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:discord_ex]]
end
```

3. Look at the examples/echo_bot.ex file and you should honestly be
   good to go.

## Realtime and Bot Client Usage

So you want to create a bot huh? Easy peezy.

1) Create a bot with a default handler to handle any event:

```elixir
# Default Fallback Handler for all events!
# This way things don't blow up when you get an event you
# have not set up a handler for.

def handle_event({event, _payload}, state) do
  IO.puts "Received Event: #{event}"
  {:ok, state}
end
```

2) Setup an event handler to handle whatever event you want:

```elixir
def handle_event({:message_create, payload}, state) do
  # Your stuff happens here #
  {:ok, state}
end
```

3) Now to start your client it is as easy as:

```elixir
{:ok, bot_client } = DiscordEx.Client.start_link(%{
	token: <token>,
	handler: YourBotHandler
})
```
where `YourBotHandler` is name of your module which implements `handle_event`.

Alright you are done. Go forth and prosper!

**As a note your bot_client is a gen_server that will have state properties that contain:**

**:client_id** - your ClientID, so you don't have to constantly ask API for it

**:rest_client** - you can use this process to make calls without having to setup another rest client connection. So in your callback you can do this in your callback with ease:

### Possible events:

Those events are described [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#events).

```elixir
:resumed
:channel_create
:channel_update
:channel_delete
:guild_update
:guild_delete
:guild_ban_add
:guild_ban_remove
:guild_emoji_update
:guild_integrations_update
:guild_member_add
:guild_member_remove
:guild_member_update
:guild_members_chunk
:guild_role_create
:guild_role_update
:guild_role_delete
:message_create
:message_update
:message_delete
:message_delete_bulk
:presence_update
:typing_start
:user_settings_update
:user_update
:voice_server_update
```

```elixir
alias DiscordEx.RestClient.Resources.User

User.current(state[:rest_client])
```


## Voice Client Usage

Keep in mind you will need to have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) and [dca-rs](https://github.com/nstafie/dca-rs) installed.

If your dca-rs is not installed as `/usr/local/bin/dca-rs` you can provide path
to it in your `config.exs` with:
```elixir
config :discord_ex, dca_rs_path: "/your/path/dca-rs"
```

**For best results that include easy accessibility and efficient process management include voice information whenoy create your client.**

1) Create a connection with initial voice channel information and voice options:

```elixir
{:ok, client} = DiscordEx.Client.start_link(%{
	token: token,
	handler: YourHandler,
	voice: %{
		guild_id: <guild_id>,
		channel_id: <initial_channel_id>,
		self_deaf: false}
})
```

2) Now in your handler you can access the voice client in your handlers state.

* state[:voice_client]


**If you want to seperate your voice client from the general client:**

1) Create a connection like before. You can attach a bot handler if you wish.

```elixir
{:ok, client } = DiscordEx.Client.start_link(%{token: <token>})
```

2) Now create a voice client as you piggy back off the bot.

```elixir
{:ok, voice_client} = DiscordEx.Voice.Client.connect(client, %{
	guild_id: <guild_id>,
	channel_id: <channel_id>
})
```

**Now just pick the audio file you want to use and play it:**

```elixir
DiscordEx.Voice.Controller.play(voice_client,"/path/to/your/audio.wav", %{volumne: 128})
```

**If you want to stop it so you can play something else just stop it:**

```elixir
DiscordEx.Voice.Controller.stop(voice_client)
```

## REST Client Usage

The easy way to use discord resources is by doing the following.

```elixir
# alias the resource you wish to use to make it easy on yourself

alias DiscordEx.RestClient.Resources.User

# Establish a connection
{:ok, connection} = User.login("<username>","<password>")

# Call on the resource and reap the results

User.guilds(connection)
```

If you like going the longer route and obtained your token already - you can use resources like this:

```elixir
# Create a connection
token = "<your-token>"
{:ok, conn} = DiscordEx.RestClient.start_link(%{token: token})

# Get to using the resource function for the rest client
DiscordEx.RestClient.resource(conn, :get, "users/@me/channels")

# You can also user other method resources like 'post':
DiscordEx.RestClient.resource(conn, :post, "users/@me/channels", %{recipient_id: <recipient_id>})
```

The 'resource' function makes it a lot easier to use the library. The following methods are supported.

```elixir
DiscordEx.RestClient.resource(conn, :get, <url>)
DiscordEx.RestClient.resource(conn, :post, <url>, <map-of-data>)
DiscordEx.RestClient.resource(conn, :put, <url>, <map-of-data>)
DiscordEx.RestClient.resource(conn, :patch, <url>, <map-of-data>)
DiscordEx.RestClient.resource(conn, :delete, <url>)
```


** The following Resources are supported - you can look at their docs for examples and more information: **

## TODOS

  * Would love more tests!
  * DRY up some similar behaviour.
  * Use it more and more - to see where developer usability can be made better
